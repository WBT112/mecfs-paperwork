# Accessibility Baseline (v1)

This project uses a minimal, regression-focused accessibility baseline.

## Scope
- Static checks via ESLint (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`)
- Runtime checks via Playwright + axe (`@axe-core/playwright`)
- Keyboard navigation smoke checks for primary actions

This baseline is intentionally small and stable. It is not a full WCAG audit.

## Gating policy
- Route scans fail only on `serious` and `critical` axe violations.
- Baseline routes:
- `/`
- `/formpacks`
- `/formpacks/doctor-letter`
- `/formpacks/offlabel-antrag` (intro gate)
- `/formpacks/offlabel-antrag` (form after intro accept, light mode)
- Chromium is the gating browser for A11y E2E checks.
- Temporary exclusions are allowed only as narrow CSS selectors in tests.
- Current temporary exclusions are limited to narrow, route-specific selectors:
  two doctor field selects and two external links inside doctor-letter info
  boxes, plus the offlabel intro gate scrollable content container.

## Local run
From `app/`:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:e2e:a11y
```

Or run the full E2E suite:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Handling failures
- Treat new `serious`/`critical` findings as regressions and fix before merge.
- If a temporary exception is unavoidable:
- add a narrow, explicit test exclusion (no broad disable),
- create a follow-up issue,
- reference the issue ID in code comments and PR description,
- remove the exception once fixed.

## Incremental adoption
- Add more core routes over time.
- Tighten severity thresholds only after backlog decreases.
- Keep checks deterministic and avoid fragile selectors.
