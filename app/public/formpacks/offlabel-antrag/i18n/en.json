In practice, similar applications may be decided differently, including in objections. There is no guarantee of approval.\n\nUsing this template can reduce formal application errors. More consistent submissions may also help increase attention for adding medications to the off-label list.\n\nAfter completion you receive three documents:\n1. Application for your health insurance\n2. Cover letter to your doctor requesting a supporting report\n3. A template for the doctor\n\nEach case is individual. Additional details, especially on severity and sources, can help.
